VersionX is a basic versioning Add-on for the MODx CMF. It keeps track of changes
to resources, and starting in VersionX 1.1, also chunks and snippets. 

Versioning is a much requested feature which is what sparked the development of this
addon. Please check out the information linked to on the Wiki for more information
about this project and please file issues if there is anything you come across.

To install from github, modify the _build/build.config.php file to reference your 
folder structure, run the build script and find the package in core/packages. Then
you can go into the Package Manager, search locally for packages and install.

Thanks for using this addon!
